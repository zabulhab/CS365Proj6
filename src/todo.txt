- consider changing how it works
    - have user click in the area of the objects to track
    - have OpenCV find the boundaries of the objects
    - keep the existing code for dense optical flow,
        but only pay attention to the values for the pixels in the object boundary
    - take convex hull of blob to determine where to put text
