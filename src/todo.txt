- consider changing how it works
    - have user click in the area of the objects to track
    - have OpenCV find the boundaries of the objects
    - keep the existing code for dense optical flow,
        but only pay attention to the values for the pixels in the object boundary
    - take convex hull of blob to determine where to put text

- thinking about using color segmentation
    - segment into colors (using posterizing) & get each individual color (using unique)
    - for each color, get mask in image & get contours from mask
    - then use same containing-contour code to figure out which contour contains click point
- troubleshooting
    - maybe instead of posterizing across all values, don't posterize in the value channel?
    - maybe just hue, even

- or instead, have user draw a box around the object. and use average flow across the entire box instead
    - means no need for finding boundaries of object from color segmentation or contouring
