Have user select box
Do optical flow for whole image
Do color segmentation of blog for similar parts inside pixels limited to area inside the ROI (the box)
Ignore areas within the box that are small and/or erratic (ie the irregular movement)
Get average flow for the mask of the biggest one-color blob within the square
Use average flow to see how much object moved
If enough distance has been traveled, then generate text:
- generate it at the end of the box, and find which side to anchor it relative to using lots of ifs and math mumbo-jumbo
if points go out of bounds, try to handle thatâ€¦somehow
